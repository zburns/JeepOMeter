iOS and Android App Speedometer

I have a 2004 Jeep Wrangler with a 3 inch lift kit and 32 inch tires.  At highway speeds the factory speedometer shows about 10 miles an hour slower than what you're actually driving.  So being cheap and instead of purchasing a new gear fo the speedometer, I wrote this app.

The app will sound a siren alarm if you are exceeding the speed.  That way I can drive with the top down and not have to look down at the speedometer...after all I'm having fun cruizing around town listening to music.

I also have different images show (by tapping on them) if you want.  Even put my Toyota Truck in there as that speedometer is a little off with the tires I have on there as well.

This is compiled with Embarcadero's Delphi RAD Studio Tokyo Update 1 (version 10.2.1)
